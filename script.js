She takes the time to explain the procedure, and gives you follow up tips. I got my teeth whitened by her here, and <b>I was incredibly impressed with the results after just one visit</b>. My teeth were significantly whiter after just one visit, what surprised me the most was that <b>I experienced no pain, or discomfort during the process or afterwards</b>. The procedure was completely painless, and there was no teeth pain after the process. I highly recommend you to have your teeth whitened by Nataliia, she is very kind and professional. Her whitening technique is the best there is out there",
